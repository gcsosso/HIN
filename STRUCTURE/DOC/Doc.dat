* The temporal evolution of the z-density does not make so much sense. If one is interested in
  monitoring z-dens along the way, the best way to do it is just be re-running the code specifying 
  different time windows

* Rings: if you're looking for DDC and/or HC cages, you better select a substantial fraction
  of the system. If you're interested instead in getting rings statistics (n. of n-membered rings)
  within the first overlayer, just select that by having a look at the actual trajectory
  - Still don't know whether ri-n or r-n... 
  -> MAXR and n- rings -> (4->6 | 5-> (up to 9) | ). Use 4 to save time when we are interested in 6-membered rings only.
     Use 5 when we are interested in a ring statistics up to 7,8 or 9-membered rings

* As the same atom can belong to rings of different size - not to mention DDC/HC cages and hexagons! - we have to choose
  which particular size/cage/hex we want to color for VMD purposes. Set WCOL as:
  0 - HEX -> user = 10
  1 - DDC/HC -> user = 15/20
  3,4,5,6,7,8,9 - _ n membered rings -> user = k
  NOTE ! If the HB switch is active, the user field for e.g. a 5-membered ring would be 500, 6 -> 600, and so on..., as per 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 !

* Clusters: usually one has oxygen, hydrogen1, hydrogen2, some virtual site, then oxygen again. The "Stride" refers to the interval between
  each oxygens. That speed up things a bit. If not, by hand, to be implemented...
  A stride=0 means by hand
  - The region considered can be specified in the plumed.dat_TEMPLATE directly (zmin/zmax or around_sphere[+/- zcut])
    Only OW plus HW1/HW2 allowed. Indexes of atoms are the only thing we change in the plumed.dat_TEMPLATE file, the rest is up to the use

* Bonds:
 Uses different z-slices with respect to z-dens, but - at the moment - the same species!

* FFS stuff:
  - If the R_CLS_ONLY keyword is set to yes, the code expects a idx.dat file (one line / nucleus, n. of particles within and list of the particles follows)
    Then, the whole rings analysis is performed onto those particles only...
  - The FFS_SURF keyword has to be switched on as well, you get a ton of stuff as the average over the whole traj (which is good, cause you are ineterested
    in properties averaged for each interface)
  - Basically the whole FFS analysis is performed within the RINGS module. A tipical input would look:

By loading the usual hin_structure.rings_cls.vmd.tcl VMD script selecting 
hin_structure.out.rings.color, particles in the nuclei should be colored by 9, and:
HEX -> user = 10
DDC/HC -> user = 15/20
