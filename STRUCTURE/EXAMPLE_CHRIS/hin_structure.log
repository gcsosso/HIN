 We have taken into account            6 frames, from frame            0  to frame            5  with stride            1
 We have written a subset of the original .xtc trajectory. See: hin_structure.out.xtc
 We have computed rings statistics. See: hin_structure.out.rings.stats
 We have            2 atomic species, namely OW  HW1 
 We have         3024 OW  
 We have         3024 HW1
