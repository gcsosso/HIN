    Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/plumed/plumed2


TO BE FIXED:
* Segfault in R.I.N.G.S. analysis of large (~2000) chunks of system. Disappear when using smaller cutoff.
Also, do I get ill defined rings? Doesn't seem like it... but I do for the Ice_IV branch, have a look!
Triple check rings statistics
* Get some timings. Some bits can probably be faster, although the bottleneck is probably PLUMED frame/frame (and bonds statistics as well)
* Check the order by which we write things in there! Looks a bit odd at the moment...
* Make it work on my Mac as well (Plumed needed!)
* Assumes:
- Ortorhombic cells. Can be improved. Need to fix this for CHLM !! TBD !!
