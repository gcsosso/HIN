 We have taken into account  5 frames, from frame  0  to frame  8  with stride  2
 We have written a subset of the original .xtc trajectory. See: hin_structure.out.xtc
 We have computed the probability density distribution of bond lengths. See: hin_structure.out.bonds
 We have  4 atomic species, namely OW oh ho HW1
 We have  10  bond pairs
 We have computed the coordination number. See: hin_structure.out.coord
 We have  4 atomic species, namely OW oh ho HW1
 We have  16  cn pairs
