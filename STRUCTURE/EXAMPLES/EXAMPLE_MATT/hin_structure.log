 We have taken into account           10 frames, from frame            0  to frame            9  with stride            1
 We have computed the number density profile along z. See: hin_structure.out.zdens
 We have            2 atomic species, namely OW  HW1 
 We have         3024 OW  
 We have         6048 HW1
