# Set of tools: structure and dynamics of the INA-water interface and ice-like clusters

Two codes only: 

% Features:
- Read .xtc trajectories
- Compute different things according to the input file
- Assume a slab geometry: some material with some water on top, typically TIP4P water. Quantities are computed along the z coordinate,
  which is supposed to be normal to the slab.
- Two makefiles & two executables, one for Linux, one other one for Mac OS

hin_structure.x ( fix time evolution of zdens and rings statistics (all rings, cages). 
- Ensemble averages and (in some selected cases...) time evolution of a number of structural quantities
  - Select which part of the traj. we are interested in, and the stride by which we consider it - DONE
  - Determine automatically which atomic species are involved, but consider a subset only, as specified in the input file - DONE
* Compute (as a function of z)
  [Just the first overlayer (or up to 2nd, 3rd). Z-range can be specified for (almost...) each quantity]
   - Density profile - DONE (no temporal evolution, but we don't care that much at the moment)
   - Coordination number - DONE (Sort of ill defined, though) TBF !!
   - Hbond (how many, donor, acceptor) - TBD -> THINK about this one. What are we exactly interested in?
     What could be the difference between one surface and another one, or the surface and the bulk? 
     Identify 1st,2nd,3rd overlayer and get HB statistics? Need more switches!
     What's important in terms of ice nucleation? Density of hbond/surface TBF !!
   - Rings statistics - DONE (clustering missing) TBF !!
     -> RINGS STATISTICS: how many rings of each size? 3-4-5-6-7-8 membered, first overlayer only - DONE
     -> Check hexagons - DONE
     -> Cluster them - TBD - Later on... TBF !!
     -> VMD colors: devise a general scheme for all the switches... - DONE
   - hbond paths - need Ali TBF !!
   - Pair correlation function between water and surface - not sure it makes sense... TBF !!
   - Voids TBF !!
   - Voronoi polyedra  - TBF !!
   - angular distribution - not sure it makes sense... - TBF !!
- Based on PLUMED (be consistent with respect to which version! Keep track of the syntax as well!)
   - Ice like nuclei:
     - Based on some OP specified in plumed.dat. Can we run it from here? 
       We need a template, a switch (only OW + HW1/HW2 allowed), some .tcl trick (.gro->.pdb), and the plumed driver 
       * Be sure to note down the version!
     - Asphericity *
     - Highest z coord, Lowest z coord *
     - Cross calculation with cages statistics (oh wow)

hin_dynamics.x (basically done, unless we come up with some other quantity)
- Time averages
  - Select which part of the traj. we are interested in, the stride by which we consider it, and the number of time origins - DONE
* Compute (as a function for z):
   - MSD -> D - DONE
   - SISF -> tau - DONE
   - CHI4 - DONE
   - HBond and water-surface bonds lifetimes - TBD
